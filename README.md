# Library Management System

This Python project simulates a Library Management System where students can borrow and return books. The library keeps track of available books and issues them to students.

## Features

- **Display Available Books:**
  - View a list of books currently available in the library.

- **Borrow a Book:**
  - Students can request to borrow a book from the library. The system checks availability and issues the book if it's available.

- **Return a Book:**
  - Students can return a borrowed book to the library.

## Implementation

The project consists of two classes:

- **Library:**
  - Manages the list of available books.
  - Displays available books.
  - Handles book borrowing and returning.

- **Student:**
  - Represents a student interacting with the library.
  - Requests and returns books.
